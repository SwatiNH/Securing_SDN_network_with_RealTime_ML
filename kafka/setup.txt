This file contains the instructions to set up a kafka data pipeline

Start ZooKeeper:
Open a new terminal and type the following command −
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

To start Kafka Broker, type the following command −
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

We will be setting up a single node configuration for simplicity. 

Creating a Kafka Topic − Kafka provides a command line utility named kafka-topics.sh to create topics on the server. Open new terminal and type the below command

bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1   
--partitions 1 --topic test-topic
This tells us that zookeeper is running on localhost server on port 2181. 
Topic Replication is the process to offer fail-over capability for a topic. Replication factor defines the number of copies of a topic in a Kafka cluster.
Since we are running a single node configuration, the number of partitions will be 1.
Once the topic has been created, you can get the notification in Kafka broker terminal window and the log for the created topic specified in “/tmp/kafka-logs/“ in the config/server.properties file.

Start Producer to Send Messages:

bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test-topic

Broker-list − The list of brokers that we want to send the messages to. In this case we only have one broker. The Config/server.properties file contains broker port id, since we know our broker is listening on port 9092, so you can specify it directly.
The producer will wait on input from stdin and publishes to the Kafka cluster. 

We will be writing a shell script to automate the network packet capture part:
There are 2 ways of doing this 
First script is as follows

#!/bin/bash/
sudo tcpdump -l | bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test-topic

Second script:

#!/bin/bash/
sudo tcpdump -l -immediate-mode >  tcpdump_packet_capture.txt
sleep 5
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test-topic < tcpdump_packet_capture.txt

To see the messages in the test-topic,
Start Consumer to Receive Messages
Similar to producer, the default consumer properties are specified in config/consumer.proper-ties file. Open a new terminal and type the below for consuming messages.

bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic test-topic --from-beginning

Finally, you are able to enter messages(network capture packets) from the producer’s terminal and see them appearing in the consumer’s terminal.
